# JaxTeller718v1.0Modlets
Modlets for use with v1.0 of 7 Days to Die

## **Increased Zombie Spawning X2, X4, X6**

Increases Wilderness and City zombie spawns by the corresponding number. Only use one at a time.

## **Bigger Wandering Hordes**

Takes the vanilla wandering hordes and adds a few extra zeds to each stage for a bigger more dangerous wandering horde. Balances the Animal Hordes as well so they aren't too crazy but have a slight increase.


## **Working Devices**

Adds a working coffeemaker, stove, sinks, microwaves and BBQ grills. All vanilla devices can be repaired, coffeemakers and grills are destroyed in world for a chance to take ne home. Stoves and Ranges are upgraded via special crafted kits. You can also make in game stoves and ovens and upgrade them at home. BBQ grills have a few special recipes in them. They can be crafted or used in world. Sinks must be upgraded. Faucets are NOT included. When fixed sinks, can be right clicked with an Empty Jar (yes they are back and found in loot) to give you some murky water.

This is an ongoing modlet so if you find any omissions or you would like some recipes added let me know. I am considering making late game dishes stove exclusives.
